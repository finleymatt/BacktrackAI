0) Project snapshot & guardrails

Prompt to Cursor

You are my senior React Native + Expo tech lead. Work in small, verifiable steps.

CONTEXT
- Expo app already runs in Expo Go and shows a Home screen.
- Goal: compliant Instagram-content organizer with Photos scan + OCR, AI tagging, search, folders, social (public folders), and a "Memories / On This Day" reminder feature.
- Must be compliant: no scraping, no private saved-bookmarks API. Ingestion via Share Sheet URL, user-shared links, and Photos library screenshots.

TASK
Create a short PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md that lists: target stack (Expo + EAS Build + optional Dev Client), key packages (expo-notifications, expo-media-library, expo-task-manager, expo-background-fetch, react-navigation, supabase-js, react-native-mmkv OR expo-sqlite), and a feature checklist with toggles.

DELIVERABLES
- /docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- Update README with "Run", "Format", "Test" commands.
- Add basic Prettier + ESLint configs.

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep Expo Go working for now; call out which steps will require a custom dev client later (OCR, Share Extension, Background tasks).

FILES
- README.md, package.json, .eslintrc.cjs, .prettierrc, docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

VERIFY
- Show npm scripts and a short explanation of when we‚Äôll need EAS Dev Client.

1) Navigation, theme, and base screens

Prompt

CONTEXT
- We have only a Home screen.

TASK
Install and wire React Navigation with a bottom tab + stack:
Tabs: Home, Search, Add, Folders, Profile, Memories
Each screen is a minimal placeholder with header titles and safe area.

DELIVERABLES
- Navigation scaffold (app/_layout or App.tsx using expo-router OR @react-navigation/native)
- Screens: HomeScreen, SearchScreen, AddScreen, FoldersScreen, ProfileScreen, MemoriesScreen
- Basic theme (light/dark) and a small UI kit (Button, Card, Text)

CONSTRAINTS
- TypeScript, strict mode.
- Keep UI simple and neutral.

VERIFY
- I can tap through all tabs without errors.

[Step -1.5] Git Setup

Prompt to Cursor

You are my senior React Native/Expo lead. I have just created a fresh Expo TypeScript app using:

  npx create-expo-app myAppName -t expo-template-blank-typescript

The app runs in Expo Go with `npm start`. Now I need to connect this project to Git and GitHub.

TASK
- Initialize a local git repo if one doesn't exist.
- Add a .gitignore suitable for Expo/React Native projects (node_modules, .expo, build outputs, etc.).
- Show me commands to make the first commit.
- Show me commands to create a new GitHub repo (from GitHub CLI OR via website).
- Provide the exact commands to add the remote and push my main branch up.
- Update my /docs/PROMPT_LOG.md to include an entry called "[Step -1.5] Git Setup".

DELIVERABLES
1. A .gitignore file tailored for Expo/React Native.
2. Step-by-step terminal commands I can run.
3. Example update for /docs/PROMPT_LOG.md.

VERIFY
- Git repository is initialized and properly configured.
- .gitignore file excludes all necessary Expo/React Native files.
- First commit is made with all project files.
- Remote repository is connected and code is pushed to GitHub.

2) Local data layer (MMKV or SQLite)

Prompt

CONTEXT
- We need local-first storage for Items, Folders, Tags, and a Memories index.

TASK
Implement a local data module:
- Choose expo-sqlite (recommended) with a small wrapper.
- Define tables: users (local shadow), items, folders, item_folders, tags, item_tags.
- Include created_at, ingested_at, source ('shared_url' | 'photo_scan').

DELIVERABLES
- src/data/db.ts (init + migrations)
- src/data/models.ts (TypeScript types)
- src/data/repositories/* (CRUD helpers)
- A simple seed function behind a dev-only command.

CONSTRAINTS
- Migrations versioned in code.
- No blocking UI on DB init.

VERIFY
- Home screen shows count of items/folders from local DB.

3) Backend: Supabase (auth + storage + optional vectors)

Prompt

CONTEXT
- We want simple cloud sync and optional semantic search later.

TASK
Set up Supabase client + schema script (SQL):
- Tables to mirror local: users, items, folders, item_folders, tags, item_tags.
- Policies: row-level security per user_id.
- Optional pgvector extension and items_embedding vector column.

DELIVERABLES
- src/lib/supabase.ts
- /supabase/schema.sql (items, folders, joins, tags, optional pgvector)
- Docs: /docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md with step-by-step dashboard instructions.

CONSTRAINTS
- Don‚Äôt break Expo Go.
- Put keys in .env and load via expo-constants or react-native-dotenv.

VERIFY
- Add a ‚ÄúSync now‚Äù button (dev-only) that upserts items/folders.
4) Permissions + Photos scan (detect screenshots)

Prompt

CONTEXT
- Need user-consented Photos access and a one-shot scan in Add screen.

TASK
Implement a Photos scanning utility using expo-media-library:
- Request permission with clear rationale.
- Enumerate recent images and detect likely Instagram screenshots via heuristics: filename matches ("IMG_*", "Screenshot"), aspect ratios common to Reels, presence of Instagram UI bands (basic pixel heuristics placeholder).
- Extract basic EXIF created time.

DELIVERABLES
- src/features/ingest/photosScan.ts
- AddScreen: "Scan Screenshots" button that ingests N sample items into local DB (source='photo_scan').

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep heuristics modular (plug in OCR later).
- Handle denied permission gracefully.

VERIFY
- After scan, Home shows new items count.

5) OCR pipeline (turn screenshots into searchable notes)
CONTEXT
- Screenshots may contain valuable text: article excerpts, video titles, Spotify track names, captions, etc.
- Need OCR to make them searchable and categorizable.

TASK
Add an OCR module with two modes:
- Mode A (demo, Expo Go): mock/cloud OCR placeholder.
- Mode B (Dev Client): integrate expo-text-recognition or similar OCR.
- Extract visible text into item.ocr_text.

DELIVERABLES
- src/features/ingest/ocr.ts
- Flag to toggle OCR on/off.
- Wire OCR into photosScan ingestion.

CONSTRAINTS
- Don‚Äôt block UI; process in background.
- Store status (ocr_done, ocr_text).

VERIFY
- ItemDetail shows extracted text snippet.
- Searching text finds items based on OCR content.


6) URL ingestion (manual entry now, APIs later)
CONTEXT
- Users often save things via URL (YouTube video, Spotify song, Instagram post, news article).
- In the future, we‚Äôll connect directly to APIs (Instagram Graph, YouTube API, Facebook, Edge bookmarks).
- For now, allow manual URL entry to simulate.

TASK
Create ‚ÄúAdd by URL‚Äù flow:
- User pastes a URL.
- Fetch allowed oEmbed/metadata (title, thumbnail).
- Persist to DB with source='url' and platform type (youtube, spotify, instagram, generic).

DELIVERABLES
- src/features/ingest/urlIngest.ts
- AddScreen > ‚ÄúAdd by URL‚Äù field + Save button.

CONSTRAINTS
- No scraping; only safe metadata fetch.
- Fallback: if metadata not available, store plain URL.

VERIFY
- Paste a URL, save ‚Üí item appears in Home with metadata.

## Database & Supabase Considerations
- **ALWAYS check if Supabase commands are needed** when dealing with database schema changes, migrations, or column issues
- **Database migrations** may require corresponding Supabase schema updates
- **Column additions/modifications** need to be reflected in both local SQLite and Supabase
- **When database errors occur** (like missing columns), consider if Supabase schema needs updating
CONTEXT
- We currently have a "Process screenshot OCR" button on the Home screen.
- I want OCR to be manual only (triggered by that button).
- The Add > "Scan Screenshots" flow should ONLY ingest screenshots and mark them as pending OCR.

TASK
A) Ingestion (no OCR)
1. Update scanScreenshots(limit=50) to:
   - Request Photos permission.
   - Fetch the 50 most recent screenshots via expo-media-library.
   - Insert items into the local DB with fields:
     ‚Ä¢ id (uuid)
     ‚Ä¢ uri
     ‚Ä¢ source = "screenshot"
     ‚Ä¢ source_date = asset.creationTime (Photos EXIF)
     ‚Ä¢ ocr_status = "pending"
     ‚Ä¢ ocr_text = null
   - Return the list of inserted item IDs.

2. Update AddScreen:
   - "Scan Screenshots" button calls scanScreenshots(50).
   - Show a loading state and a success toast with ‚ÄúImported N screenshots (OCR pending)‚Äù.
   - Do NOT call any OCR function here.

B) Manual OCR processing on Home
1. Add a data service: processPendingScreenshotOCR({ batchSize = 10 }):
   - Query up to `batchSize` items where source="screenshot" AND ocr_status="pending".
   - For each, call extractTextFromImage(uri) from src/features/ingest/ocr.ts.
   - Update item.ocr_text and set ocr_status="done".
   - Return counts: { processed, remaining }.

2. Wire the existing Home button "Process screenshot OCR":
   - On press: disable button, show progress indicator.
   - Repeatedly call processPendingScreenshotOCR() in batches until remaining=0
     OR until a safety cap (e.g., max 5 batches per press) to keep UI responsive.
   - On completion: show toast ‚ÄúOCR complete: X items processed. Y remaining.‚Äù

3. Add idempotency guards:
   - Skip items where ocr_status="done".
   - If OCR throws for an item, set ocr_status="error" and continue.

DELIVERABLES
- src/features/ingest/photosScan.ts
  ‚Ä¢ export async function scanScreenshots(limit=50): Promise<string[]>
- src/features/ingest/ocr.ts
  ‚Ä¢ (ensure) export async function extractTextFromImage(uri): Promise<string>
- src/features/ingest/ocrQueue.ts
  ‚Ä¢ export async function processPendingScreenshotOCR(opts?: { batchSize?: number, maxBatchesPerRun?: number }): Promise<{ processed:number, remaining:number }>
- src/screens/AddScreen.tsx
  ‚Ä¢ Call scanScreenshots(50) only; remove auto-OCR
- src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx
  ‚Ä¢ Hook up "Process screenshot OCR" button to call processPendingScreenshotOCR in a loop with UI feedback

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep compatible with Expo Go:
  ‚Ä¢ If native OCR isn‚Äôt available, extractTextFromImage should return a mocked string and we still mark items "done" with a note (e.g., ‚Äú[mocked OCR]‚Äù).
- Non-blocking UI: no long-running locks on the main thread; show progress (e.g., ‚ÄúProcessing‚Ä¶ (10/50)‚Äù).
- Errors must not halt the batch; collect errors and continue.

VERIFY
- Scan Screenshots imports 50 recent screenshots and shows ‚Äú(OCR pending)‚Äù in item details or count.
- Pressing ‚ÄúProcess screenshot OCR‚Äù runs in batches, updates items to ocr_status="done", and displays a final toast with processed/remaining counts.
- Re-pressing the button when no pending items shows ‚ÄúNo pending screenshots to process.‚Äù


10) Memories / Source-date resurfacing (yearly + month intervals)
CONTEXT
- Memories should resurface items based on the ORIGINAL SOURCE DATE (source_date), not ingestion.
  ‚Ä¢ Screenshots ‚Üí Photos EXIF created_at
  ‚Ä¢ YouTube/Instagram ‚Üí saved_at from platform APIs
  ‚Ä¢ Spotify/Facebook/Edge ‚Üí bookmark/save date once integrated
- Trigger patterns:
  1) Yearly ‚ÄúOn This Day‚Äù (same month/day in prior years, with ¬±7d window)
  2) Month intervals at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 months ago (same day-of-month, with ¬±3d window; handle month-end gracefully)

TASK
Implement a Memories selector using source_date:
1) Compute candidate windows for:
   - Yearly: for each prior year Y where Y < current year, window = [today-7d, today+7d] but with year replaced by Y.
   - Months: for M ‚àà {2,4,6,8,10}, window = [today shifted by -M months] ¬±3d; if the original day doesn‚Äôt exist (e.g., Feb 30), clamp to last day of month.
2) Query items whose source_date falls in any of the windows.
3) Group results by ‚Äúpattern‚Äù (Yearly vs 2m/4m/6m/8m/10m) and by year/month for display.
4) Settings:
   - cadence: "daily" | "weekly"
   - quiet_hours: { start, end }
   - include_private: boolean (default false)
   - include_intervals: { yearly: true, months_2_4_6_8_10: true } (toggle month intervals on/off)
   - window_days: { yearly: 7, monthly: 3 } (make configurable)
5) UI:
   - MemoriesScreen shows chips/tabs for ‚ÄúYearly‚Äù and ‚ÄúMonths Ago‚Äù
   - Cards list with actions: Snooze (X days), Dismiss, ‚ÄúShow fewer like this‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdd to Folder‚Äù, Share

DELIVERABLES
- src/features/memories/selectMemories.ts
  ‚Ä¢ function getMemoriesWindows(today, settings): DateRange[]
  ‚Ä¢ function selectMemories(windows): Promise<MemoryItem[]>
  ‚Ä¢ Month-end clamp helper and window union/deduplication
- src/features/memories/settings.ts (types + defaults + persistence)
- MemoriesScreen wired to selector; grouped sections + actions

CONSTRAINTS
- Index source_date in local DB for fast range queries
- Items without source_date: exclude, or fallback to ingested_at with a flag (settings.allow_fallback = false by default)
- Make it easy to inject platform-specific save dates when integrations land

VERIFY
- Seed data:
  ‚Ä¢ Screenshot taken exactly 6 months ago ‚Üí appears under ‚Äú6 months ago‚Äù
  ‚Ä¢ Instagram saved on this date 3 years ago ‚Üí appears under ‚ÄúOn This Day (3y)‚Äù
  ‚Ä¢ Edge bookmark saved ~+2 days around target date ‚Üí appears due to ¬±3d monthly window

7) Search (text + filters across screenshots & URLs)
CONTEXT
- We now have items from screenshots + URLs (later from APIs).
- Need a way to find notes quickly.

TASK
Implement local search:
- Keyword search across title, OCR text, URL domain, tags.
- Filters: source type (screenshot, url, platform-specific), date range, tag.
- Display results in SearchScreen.

DELIVERABLES
- src/features/search/search.ts
- SearchScreen wired with debounced input + filter controls.

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep local for speed; cloud search later.

VERIFY
- Searching ‚ÄúSpotify‚Äù or ‚Äúhiking‚Äù returns relevant notes.
